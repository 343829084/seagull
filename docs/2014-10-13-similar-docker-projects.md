# Similar Docker Projects

[中文文档](2014-10-13-similar-docker-projects-zh.md)

There are some similar projects which provide Web UI to monitor docker. Seagull is inspired by them but we could be better than them.

I would like to introduce them to you and everyone has his or her choice to use whatever he or she wants.

## Dockerui

Here is the github page, <https://github.com/crosbymichael/dockerui>.

You may notice that UI of seagull is kind of like dockerui. Because we both use Bootstap and AngularJS as front-end frameworks. It's great project and has almost 2000 stars in github.

Seagull learns a lot from dockerui, including use JQuery.gritter for notification. But the UI of dockerui is not clean. It will never think about i18n(internationalization) but I do. I could do more for developers all around the world. The dockerui hasn't supported search yet and seagull is good at this.

Dockerui and seagull are the same products to monitor docker deamon. You don't have to use both of them. And our goal is to replace dockerui with a more friendly and useful UI.

## Shipyard

## Cadvisor

## I will check it out later

## Docker Registry Web
